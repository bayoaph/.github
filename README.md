# About Bayoa Repositories

These repositories are documentation of software codes used in Bayoa projects. Most of these repositories are not for public consumption and confidentiality is important. However, there will be more public repositories in the future. They will be useful in learning, community service, and/or just simply contributing to the world.

Carpe diem!
